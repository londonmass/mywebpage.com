		 <h3>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</h3>

			<h1>CSS</h1>
			<p>
				CSS(<b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>) is used to style a webpage. There are 2 types of CSS:
				<ul>
					<li id="ICSS">Internal CSS</li>
					<li id="ECSS">External CSS</li>
				</ul>
				Internal CSS is only accesible with one CSS code, while external CSS is accesible from multiple HTML codes. CSS is important so your webpage is not bland. If your webpage is bland, then it will not keep users. More color in the webpage, the less your webpage will be bland.
